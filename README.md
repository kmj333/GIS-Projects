### Visualization 1

#### To create this map highlighting lakes, roads, and wetlands, I began by loading vector data layers from a geopackage using the Data Source Manager. Each layer was carefully organized: lakes in blue, roads as precise lines, and wetlands in green. This setup ensured a clear and intuitive representation of the natural and built environments.
