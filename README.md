#### This GIS map features lakes in the region, using vector data from a geopackage. Styled with distinct blue shading, the lakes are prominently displayed, making their spatial distribution clear and easy to analyze in relation to roads and wetlands. To create this map, I loaded vector data layers from the geopackage using the Data Source Manager, ensuring a clear and intuitive representation of the natural environments and roads.
